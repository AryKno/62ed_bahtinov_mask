# Bahtinov Mask for the Skywatcher Evolux 62Ed

I designed this Bahtinov mask to fit the Evolux 62ED lens from SkyWatcher. I was unable to find any on internet so I publish it.

- I generated an SVG of the mask with https://astrojargon.net/
- I converted the SVG into a DXF file with an online converter
- I worked with the DXF into Autodesk Fusion 360
